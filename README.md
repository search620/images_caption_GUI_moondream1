**Image Captioning Application using moondream1 model**

This Image Captioning Application is a user-friendly desktop GUI tool designed to automatically generate captions for images using advanced deep learning models. Built with Python and leveraging the power of the Transformers library, it offers a seamless way for users to upload images and receive descriptive captions, enhancing accessibility and understanding of visual content.

**Features**
Easy-to-Use Interface: A simple and intuitive GUI allows users to upload and navigate through images effortlessly.
CUDA Acceleration: Utilizes CUDA for GPU acceleration (if available) using half-precision for better memory efficiency (8gb v-ram), ensuring fast processing and caption generation.
Multi-Threaded Model Loading: Implements multi-threaded loading of the deep learning model to improve startup time and responsiveness.
Export Functionality: Users can export generated captions to text files, making it easy to save among the images.
Dynamic Model Status Indicator: Includes a real-time indicator that notifies users when the model is loaded and ready to generate captions.


The GUI is one EXE file for convenience just click and run the APP.

I also upload the script as open-sourcing for anyone who wants to adjust or improve this.
